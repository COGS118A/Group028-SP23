A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "In today’s competitive job market, estimating future salary is a crucial aspect for both college students and education institutions. By machine learning techniques, our goal is to develop a predictive model that could estimate the salary of college graduates based on their academic achievements. We used a kaggle dataset that showed various features that reflect their performance in college, such as GPA, degree, or AMCAT scores. Most features are measured numerically, for those who are not in numeric form such as degree or gender, we will use one hot encoding method. With this data, we will identify the top 10 most significant features that contribute to the salary and we will use linear regression to train the data sets. Our model's performance will be matured based on the difference between true salary and the predicted salary. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "College students' salaries are influenced by various factors, including gender, college rank, major choice, and standardized test scores such as the AMCAT. Understanding the relationship between these factors and salary outcomes is crucial for informed decision-making and addressing potential disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender plays a significant role in salary discrepancies among college graduates. Despite advancements in gender equality, women often face lower wages compared to men. Analyzing salary data can provide insights into the extent of these disparities, helping policymakers develop strategies to promote pay equity and fair employment practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prestige of the college attended also impacts salary prospects. Higher-ranked colleges often offer better resources, networking opportunities, and career services, which can translate into higher starting salaries. Exploring the connection between college rank and salaries can inform educational institutions about the value of enhancing career support for students and strengthening alumni networks.\n",
    "The choice of major is another influential factor. Certain fields, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, typically yield higher-paying job opportunities. Evaluating the correlation between major choice and salary outcomes can guide students in making informed educational and career decisions while enabling educators to identify areas for curriculum enhancement and support in fields with lower earning potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, standardized tests like the AMCAT score can impact salary prospects. The AMCAT measures job applicants' aptitude and skills, serving as a benchmark for employability. Analyzing the relationship between AMCAT scores and salaries can help students understand the potential significance of test performance on future earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning techniques can effectively analyze relevant datasets to derive valuable insights. Predictive modeling can forecast salary outcomes based on factors such as gender, college rank, major, and AMCAT scores. Feature importance analysis can identify the relative significance of these factors in salary determination. Machine learning algorithms can also be employed for clustering and segmentation, helping identify patterns and target specific groups for interventions. By leveraging machine learning, policymakers and educators can gain actionable information to promote fair salary practices, address disparities, and support informed decision-making for college students.

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform multi-class classification in logistic regression model to estimate the total salary of a student based on various features of shown in dataset. Since there are multiple categories to describe the status of a student, we can train the dataset across different variables and then estimate the final result in salary column. Also, we can use the one-hot encoding method to include the categorical variables in our analysis. Other model can also be applied to our machine learning. The MSE score is the main evaluation matrics in the solution. When incorporated in the k-folds cross validation, the mean of the MSE across the datasets can be used to present the overall performance of the model. Other algorithem can be applied to this dataset as well. K Nearest Neighbor, decision tree and SVM can also be used to determine a more robust model to generalize the datasets in different perspectives."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    " In our problem, one reasonalble evaluatoin metrix to use would be MSE (Mean Squared Error). MSE is considered a rather common metric for evaluating the performance of a regression model. This model measures the average squared difference between the predicted values of the model and the actual values from the dataset. Here is a mathematical representatin of the MSE: MSE = (1/n) * Σ(yi - ŷi)^2. N is the number of data points in total; yi refers to the actual value of the variable for the i-th data point, and ŷi refers to the predicted value of the variable for the i-th data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the MSE is always greater than zero, a lower MSE indicates a better performance for the model, as the predicted value is closer to the real value in the dataset. It provides a measure of how well the model fits the data and how close the predicted values are to the actual values. However, since MSE is squared, it penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morever, k-folds cross validation can be used along with MSE. By shuffling the training data and evaluated k-times, overfitting and accuracy of the model can be trained at best. The MSE values in our cross-validation can be averaged to provide an overall assessment of the model's performance."

    "This dataset is publicly available thanks to 'Aspiring Minds Research', and provides income and educational details about recent graduates from Indian engineering and technology institutions. There are always concerns about privacy and exposure when working with data collected from indiviudals, however in this case our dataset does not contain much personally identifiable information so their is less risk of people being targeted and harmed. The only PII is date of birth but without any other information this is not very valuable. We also do interact with the participants' actual income as well as educational information such as GPA and exam scores. Hopefully the anonymity of the samples will protect the participants in this regard but we must still be cautious when handling data such as this. We must also consider potential biases in the data that could arise from factors such as gender, age, location, and other circumstances. We will deal with potential privacy concerns by ensuring the data is solely used for the purposes outlined by our project. "
